  "script": "While Spider-Man is fighting his arch-nemesis, Doctor Octopus, in a dark alley, the villain reveals a strange new green power that catches him off guard. Ock destroys the only light, but Spidey\u2019s Spider-Sense helps him dodge the attacks in the dark. Just as he gets cornered and slammed into a wall, the powerful hero Invincible suddenly appears, smashing Doc Ock into a wall. After a brief misunderstanding where Invincible apologizes for attacking a villain, Doc Ock recovers and attacks again, only for Invincible to knock him out for good. Their victory is cut short when police arrive, mistaking them for criminals and forcing the two heroes to escape to a nearby rooftop.\n\nThere, an emotional Invincible explains that he\u2019s from another dimension, stranded by a villain named Angstrom Levy who is teleporting him between worlds to weaken him. He shares his tragic family history and worries that the villain has also targeted his mother. Convinced by his story, Spider-Man decides to help and takes him to Avengers Tower. Invincible is shocked to learn Spidey is an Avenger and gets a comical introduction to Captain America, Iron Man, and Wolverine. After Iron Man tracks the now-escaped Doctor Octopus to the city harbor, Spider-Man tells the team that he and Invincible can handle it alone.\n\nAt the harbor, they find Ock terrorizing civilians. Invincible struggles with Spider-Man\u2019s no-kill rule, trying not to use his full strength during the fight. Growing frustrated with the prolonged battle, Invincible finally grabs two of the villain\u2019s mechanical arms and crushes them, ending the confrontation. Just then, a glowing green portal appears, giving Invincible his ticket home. After a quick thank you from the police, the two heroes say their goodbyes. Invincible flies through the portal, and as it closes, Spider-Man swings home, thinking about his new friend and wishing him luck.",
