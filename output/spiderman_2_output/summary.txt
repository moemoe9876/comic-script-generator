The story begins with Spider-Man in a nighttime confrontation with his arch-nemesis, Doctor Octopus, in a dirty city alley. Despite Spider-Man's typical barrage of taunts, Doctor Octopus reveals a new, glowing green power that catches the hero by surprise. The villain attempts to gain the upper hand by destroying the only light source, but Spider-Man's Spider-Sense allows him to continue evading the mechanical arms in the dark. Eventually, Doctor Octopus corners Spider-Man and slams him into a wall. Just as the situation looks grim, Spider-Man is unexpectedly saved by the sudden arrival of Invincible, a powerful flying hero who smashes Doctor Octopus into a wall.

A brief misunderstanding follows, as Invincible—unfamiliar with this dimension's villains—apologizes for attacking Doctor Octopus. Just as Spider-Man clarifies that Ock is a dangerous criminal, the villain recovers and attacks Invincible, who retaliates and knocks him out again. Their victory is cut short by the arrival of armed police who mistake them for criminals, forcing the two heroes to flee the scene together.

Finding sanctuary on a city rooftop, an emotional Invincible reveals the truth: he is from another dimension, stranded there by a villain named Angstrom Levy who is torturing him by teleporting him between worlds to weaken him. He shares his tragic backstory about his villainous father, Omni-Man, and expresses deep concern for the safety of his mother, who Levy has targeted before. Convinced of his sincerity, Spider-Man sympathizes with Invincible and the two formally introduce themselves, leading to a lighthearted debate about the creativity of their superhero names.

Deciding to team up, Spider-Man brings Invincible to his home, where he briefly meets Aunt May and Mary Jane Watson before they head to Avengers Tower for help tracking the now-escaped Doctor Octopus. Invincible is stunned to learn that Spider-Man is a member of the Avengers and has a comical introduction to the team, which includes Captain America, Iron Man, and Wolverine, whose names he proceeds to mock. Iron Man tracks Doctor Octopus to the city harbor, and Spider-Man, declining the Avengers' help, sets off with Invincible to handle the villain themselves.

Arriving at the harbor, they find Doctor Octopus terrorizing civilians, having set a trap to lure Spider-Man out. In the ensuing battle, Invincible struggles to hold back his strength as per Spider-Man's no-kill rule. Becoming frustrated with the prolonged fight and Doctor Octopus's relentless mechanical arms, Invincible ends the confrontation decisively by grabbing two of the arms and crushing them. In the aftermath, a glowing green portal appears—Invincible's ticket home. As a grateful police officer lets them go, Invincible and Spider-Man say their goodbyes. Invincible flies through the portal, and Spider-Man has a last-second impulse to follow and help but is left behind as it closes. Swinging home, Spider-Man reflects on the near-miss of being stranded in another dimension and wishes his new friend good luck.
