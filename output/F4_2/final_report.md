**Script:**
On the eve of his wedding, Doctor Doom reassures his fiancÃ©e, Victorious, that their marriage is purely a political move to make her queen. He knows her deepest secretâ€”her Symkarian heritageâ€”and as a wedding gift, he reveals he's annexed her homeland, a chilling display of his power. He gives her a new mask, and they toast to her future under his eternal reign.

The Fantastic Four are shocked when Reed Richards announces he must be Doom's best man after losing a duel. But there's a powerful reason to go: Latverian tradition promises a "clean slate" to all guests who attend in peace, forgiving all past conflicts. Sue is tired of fighting, and Ben wants absolution. But for a guilt-ridden Johnny Storm, who secretly slept with Victorious, it's a desperate chance for redemption. His attempt to bring his soulmate for backup ends in a painful rejection, leaving him alone with his turmoil.

Upon arriving in Latveria, the team immediately confronts Doom. Sue is furious he scheduled the wedding on her anniversary, and Ben is angry Doom ruined his own wedding. Doom just offers arrogant, insincere apologies. That night, Johnny tries to see Victorious, only for her to violently intercept him. She coldly rebuffs his pleas, claiming the marriage is her patriotic duty. And while Reed clings to the hope of peace by refusing to bug Doom's ring, Doom secretly preserves his most dangerous weapon.

The wedding day arrives, with guests like Black Panther and Namor. As The Thing walks Victorious down the aisle, she coldly states her traitorous father is dead and she's glad. The ceremony begins, but after Doom takes his vows, Victorious interrupts. Believing there can be no secrets, she makes a stunning confession: she slept with Johnny Storm. Doomâ€™s reaction isn't jealousy, but volcanic fury at the public humiliation. He unleashes a massive energy blast, shattering the peace. As the heroes charge, they are suddenly paralyzed. Doom reveals his ultimate betrayal: the "clean slate" was a binding spell, a trap preventing them from fighting back. With everyone helpless, Doom sentences them all to death, as a defeated Ben Grimm looks at Reed, his bitter prediction coming true.

## ï¿½ Story Summary

The story opens on the eve of a monumental event: the wedding of Doctor Doom. In a private dinner, he reassures his fiancÃ©e, the formidable Victorious, that their marriage is a political masterstroke to install her as Latveriaâ€™s queen. Sensing her self-doubt, Doom reveals he knows her deepest secretâ€”her Symkarian heritageâ€”and nullifies it by declaring he has annexed her homeland as a wedding gift, a chilling display of power and possession. He presents her with a new mask, and they toast to her future and his eternal reign.

The inciting incident for the Fantastic Four is Reed Richardsâ€™s shocking announcement: having lost a duel to Doom, he is honor-bound to serve as the best man. The team is appalled, but Reed reveals a powerful incentive: Latverian tradition dictates that all who attend the wedding in peace will be granted a "clean slate," their past transgressions against Doom forgiven. This promise resonates deeply with each member. Sue is weary of the endless conflict, Ben wants absolution for past battles, and a guilt-ridden Johnny Stormâ€”who secretly slept with Victoriousâ€”sees a desperate, unstated path to redemption. His attempt to invite his soulmate, Sky, as backup ends in a painful rejection, leaving him isolated in his turmoil.

Upon arriving in a tense Latveria, the team is immediately confronted by Doom. He senses Sueâ€™s agitation, which she reveals is fury that he scheduled the wedding on her and Reedâ€™s anniversary. Ben likewise confronts Doom for ruining his own wedding. Doom offers only arrogant, insincere apologies, reinforcing the deep-seated animosity between them. That night, Johnny foolishly attempts to see Victorious, only to be violently intercepted by her. She coldly rebuffs his pleas, claiming the marriage is her patriotic duty, shattering his hopes. Meanwhile, Reed, clinging to the possibility of true peace, refuses Sueâ€™s pragmatic suggestion to bug Doomâ€™s wedding ring, insisting they must act in good faith. In a moment of dramatic irony, Doom orders his weaponeers to dismantle all anti-FF projects, seemingly honoring the truce while secretly preserving his most dangerous weapon.

The wedding day arrives, attended by royalty like a wary Black Panther and a curious Namor. The Thing escorts Victorious down the aisle, where she shocks him by coldly stating her traitorous father is long dead and she is glad. The ceremony begins, but just after Doom takes his vows, Victorious interrupts. Believing there can be no secrets between them, she makes a stunning public confession: she has been intimate with his enemy, Johnny Storm.

Doomâ€™s reaction is not jealousy, but volcanic fury at the public humiliation. He unleashes a massive energy blast, shattering the fragile peace. As the heroesâ€”the FF, Black Panther, and Namorâ€”charge forward, they are suddenly paralyzed. Doom stands triumphant, revealing his ultimate betrayal: the "non-aggression pact" was a binding spell, twisting his promise of forgiveness into a trap that prevents anyone from raising a hand against him. With his guests helpless, Doom sentences them all to death. As his guards close in, a defeated Ben Grimm looks at his best friend and utters a bitter, heartbreaking, "I told ya so."
