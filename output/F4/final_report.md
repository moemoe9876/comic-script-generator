**Script:**
Doctor Doom is getting married, and on the eve of the wedding, he drops a bombshell on his fianc√©e, Victorious. He tells her their marriage is purely political, and as a twisted gift, he has annexed her homeland to erase her "shameful" heritage. Trapped, Zora has no choice but to toast her new king.

Meanwhile, Reed Richards stuns the Fantastic Four by announcing he‚Äôs Doom‚Äôs best man. Despite their history, Reed explains that a Latverian tradition grants a "clean slate" to all guests, forgiving past conflicts. For Johnny Storm, this trip is deeply personal; he's reeling from a breakup and wants to confront Zora, who he secretly slept with.

Their arrival in Latveria is tense. They‚Äôre greeted by Doom flanked by menacing tigers. Sue confronts him for scheduling the wedding on her anniversary, while Ben reminds him of how he ruined his own. But Doom just offers empty apologies. That night, a desperate Johnny flies to Zora‚Äôs window, only to be shot down by her defenses. She coldly tells him her duty is to her country and she will marry Doom. In a show of good faith, Reed refuses to bug Doom‚Äôs ring, and Doom seemingly dismantles his entire anti-FF arsenal.

The wedding day arrives. Black Panther and Namor are among the guests, and The Thing even walks a stone-faced Zora down the aisle. But as the ceremony begins, Zora stops everything. She confesses she can‚Äôt marry him with a secret, revealing to the entire crowd that she was intimate with his greatest enemy, Johnny Storm.

Humiliated before his nation, Doom‚Äôs fury is absolute. He unleashes a massive energy blast. As the heroes charge forward to fight, they‚Äôre all suddenly frozen in place. Doom reveals his ultimate betrayal: the invitation was a sorcerous spell, making it physically impossible to attack him. With his enemies helpless, Doctor Doom gives his final, chilling command: kill them all.

## ÔøΩ Story Summary

The story opens on the eve of a monumental event: the wedding of Doctor Doom. In a private dinner, he informs his fianc√©e, his loyal herald Victorious, that their marriage is a political ceremony to install her as Latveria‚Äôs queen. Sensing her unease, Doom reveals he knows her deepest secret: her Symkarian heritage. As a twisted wedding gift, he has annexed her homeland, absorbing it into Latveria to erase her "shame" and bind her to him. Torn between duty and a hidden past, Zora Vukovic toasts to Doom‚Äôs reign, her future sealed.

Meanwhile, in the Baxter Building, Reed Richards stuns his family with the news that he is to be Doom‚Äôs best man. The Fantastic Four are invited guests. Despite their deep-seated skepticism, Reed persuades them by revealing a Latverian tradition: Doom will grant a "clean slate," forgiving all past transgressions of those who attend. For Ben, Sue, and Johnny, each nursing personal grudges against the tyrant, the offer is too strategic to refuse. A heartsick Johnny, reeling from a breakup with his soulmate Sky, sees the trip as a chance to confront Zora, with whom he shared a secret, passionate encounter.

The team‚Äôs arrival in Latveria is fraught with tension. Escorted by Doombots to Castle Von Doom, they are greeted by their armored host flanked by menacing tigers. The fragile peace is immediately tested as Sue confronts Doom for scheduling the wedding on her anniversary, while Ben reminds him of how he ruined his own wedding. Doom offers only hollow apologies, his focus absolute. That night, Johnny‚Äôs desperation boils over. He flies to Zora‚Äôs window but is shot down by automated defenses. Zora, revealing she is remotely piloting a Servo-Droid to protect him from her own army, coldly rebuffs his pleas. She declares her love for her country is paramount, and her marriage to Doom is a duty she will not forsake. In a parallel moment of trust, Reed refuses Sue‚Äôs suggestion to bug Doom‚Äôs wedding ring, insisting they must honor the truce. Seemingly in good faith, Doom orders his weaponeers to dismantle his entire anti-Fantastic Four arsenal.

The wedding day arrives, a grand affair attended by dignitaries like Black Panther and Namor. The Thing, in a moment of surprising tenderness, walks a stone-faced Zora down the aisle. But as the officiant speaks of a sacred oath binding their souls in absolute trust, Zora falters. Before the assembled crowd and her waiting king, she makes a stunning confession: she cannot marry him with a secret between them. She reveals she has been intimate with his greatest enemy, Johnny Storm.

Humiliated before his nation and his rivals, Doom‚Äôs fury is apocalyptic. He unleashes a devastating energy blast, scattering the guests. As Black Panther, Namor, and The Thing charge forward to fight, they are suddenly frozen in place, paralyzed alongside every other hero. Doom reveals his ultimate betrayal: the "non-aggression pact" was a sorcerous spell, making aggression against him physically impossible. He had trapped them all. Surrounded by his army, with his enemies helpless before him, Doctor Doom gives his final, chilling command: "Kill them all."
