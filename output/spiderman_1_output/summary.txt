The story begins with Spider-Man in a tense nighttime confrontation with Doctor Octopus in a dirty city alley. Despite Spider-Man's relentless taunts about his age and stamina, the veteran villain proves formidable. After Spider-Man webs his goggles, Doc Ock destroys the area's light source, plunging them into darkness. Though Spider-Man's Spider-Sense allows him to dodge initial attacks, a moment of overconfident banter leaves him open to being struck and slammed against a brick wall. As Doctor Octopus holds him captive in a mechanical tentacle, furious at the constant chatter, he dismisses Spider-Man's desperate "look behind you" trick as a cheap ploy.

Suddenly, the distraction becomes real. A new, flying hero—Invincible—crashes the party, having been thrown through a dimensional portal. The fight becomes a chaotic three-way brawl. At one point, Doctor Octopus manages to hurl Invincible back through another portal, which quickly closes. Spider-Man, confused, mistakenly assumes a local hero like Thor took care of the situation. However, Invincible reappears, standing over a seemingly defeated Doctor Octopus. A misunderstanding ensues where Invincible, trying to explain he's from another dimension, questions how dangerous Doc Ock truly is. Provoked, the villain recovers and violently smashes Invincible through a wall. Invincible retaliates with overwhelming force, defeating Doctor Octopus just as the police arrive, forcing both heroes to flee.

On a quiet rooftop at sunset, a concerned Spider-Man lectures Invincible about using excessive force, fearing he might have killed the villain. The conversation takes an emotional turn when Spider-Man notices Invincible is crying. Invincible confesses his true predicament: he is Mark Grayson from another universe, and a villain named Angstrom Levy is forcibly teleporting him between dimensions to weaken him for a final battle. He recounts his tragic origin, including his own father's betrayal and a recent attack by Levy on his mother, leaving him stranded and worried.

Empathetic to his struggle, Spider-Man decides to trust him. After formally introducing themselves and playfully mocking each other's "lame" superhero names, Invincible offers to help with local hero duties while he's stuck. Spider-Man accepts, proposing they team up to find Doctor Octopus, starting at Avengers Tower. Invincible is stunned to learn what the Avengers are and even more shocked to discover Spider-Man is a member. Their first stop is not the tower, but Peter's apartment, where they surprise Aunt May and Mary Jane. To ease the tension, Invincible unmasks as Mark, and Peter apologetically cancels his movie night with MJ. Later, at Avengers Tower, Invincible meets the full team—Captain America, Iron Man, Wolverine, and others—and proceeds to sarcastically guess their names ("Flag-Man," "Robot-Man"), causing a dejected Spider-Man to wonder if his own name "does suck."

After explaining the situation to the Avengers, Spider-Man and Invincible get a new lead on Doctor Octopus's location at the harbor. Declining the Avengers' help, the duo sets off, with Invincible carrying Spider-Man when his web-line snaps mid-swing. They arrive to find Doctor Octopus terrorizing civilians, having orchestrated the chaos specifically to lure Spider-Man out. In the ensuing battle, the heroes work together. Frustrated with the prolonged fight and Doctor Octopus's relentless attacks, Invincible reaches his breaking point, grabbing two of the villain's mechanical tentacles and crushing them with his bare hands, decisively ending the confrontation.

Just as they secure the villain, a glowing green portal appears. Invincible recognizes it as his involuntary transport to the next dimension. After a grateful police officer tells him to go save the world, Invincible and Spider-Man share a quick, friendly goodbye. As Invincible flies into the portal, Spider-Man has a last-second, impulsive idea to follow and help, shooting a web-line after him. The portal snaps shut, severing the web and leaving him behind. Swinging home alone through the dusk-lit city, Spider-Man reflects on the day's bizarre events and the risk he almost took, ultimately deciding he's better off at home with his wife and wishing his new interdimensional friend the best of luck.
