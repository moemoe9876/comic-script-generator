  "script": "While Spider-Man is fighting Doctor Octopus in a dark alley, a new hero suddenly crashes the party, getting thrown through a dimensional portal. After webbing the villain's goggles, Spidey finds himself in complete darkness when Doc Ock destroys the only light source. A moment of overconfidence gets Peter slammed against a wall, but before the villain can finish him, the new hero, Invincible, returns. The fight becomes a chaotic three-way brawl until Invincible smashes Doc Ock through a wall, just as the police arrive, forcing both heroes to flee.\n\nOn a rooftop, a concerned Spider-Man lectures the new guy about using excessive force. The conversation shifts when he notices Invincible is crying. Invincible confesses he's actually Mark Grayson from another universe, being forcibly teleported between dimensions by a villain named Angstrom Levy who is trying to weaken him for a final fight. Sympathetic to his struggle, Spider-Man decides to trust him. After a quick stop to surprise Aunt May and MJ, they head to Avengers Tower, where Invincible meets the team and hilariously guesses all of their names wrong.\n\nAfter getting a lead on Doc Ock's location at the harbor, the new duo sets off, declining the Avengers' help. They find the villain terrorizing civilians to lure Spider-Man into a trap. As they team up to fight him, Invincible grows frustrated with the prolonged battle. Reaching his breaking point, he grabs two of Doc Ock's mechanical arms and crushes them with his bare hands, decisively ending the confrontation. Just as they secure the villain, a green portal appears. Knowing it's his ride to the next dimension, Invincible shares a quick goodbye with Spider-Man. As Mark flies into the portal, Peter impulsively shoots a web-line to follow, but it snaps shut, leaving him behind to swing home alone.",
