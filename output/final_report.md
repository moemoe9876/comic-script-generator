**Script:**
In a gritty New York alley, Spider-Man is locked in a fierce battle with Doctor Octopus. His usual taunts are cut short when a glowing green portal erupts nearby. And just as Doc Ock gains the upper hand, slamming Spidey into a wall, a new hero named Invincible bursts from the portal, hurling the villain away and saving the web-slinger.

The two heroes reconvene over the dazed villain, only for a recovered Ock to grab Spider-Man and smash Invincible through a building. Invincible retaliates with overwhelming force, punching Ock through another wall before they both flee to a rooftop. There, Spider-Man scolds him for using potentially lethal force. The criticism shatters Invincible‚Äôs stoic facade, and he breaks down, crying. He confesses a villain named Angstrom Levy is torturing him by throwing him through realities, all after attacking his mother to learn his identity. He even recounts how his own father, Omni-Man, betrayed his family and the world. Seeing his pain, Spider-Man immediately empathizes, offering his trust. After a lighthearted debate where Invincible calls his name ‚Äúlame,‚Äù they decide to team up.

Spider-Man takes Invincible to Avengers Tower for help, but not before a quick, awkward stop at his apartment where the hero meets Aunt May and Mary Jane. At the tower, Iron Man locates Doc Ock at the harbor. At the docks, Ock reveals the whole rampage was a deliberate trap. Annoyed by the prolonged fight, a frustrated Invincible grabs two of the villain‚Äôs mechanical arms and just rips them apart.

Immediately, another portal opens. Understanding this is his only way home, Invincible shares a quick farewell and flies toward it. In a last-second decision, Spider-Man shoots a web-line to follow, wanting to help. But the portal snaps shut, severing the web. Left alone, Spider-Man reflects on the danger he almost jumped into and swings home.

## ÔøΩ Story Summary

The story ignites in a gritty New York alley, where Spider-Man‚Äôs signature taunts echo during a fierce battle with Doctor Octopus. The fight is a whirlwind of webbing and flailing mechanical arms until a mysterious, glowing green portal erupts nearby. Just as an enraged Doc Ock gains the upper hand, slamming Spider-Man into a wall, a new figure, Invincible, bursts from the portal and hurls the villain away, saving the web-slinger. Confused by his powerful, flying savior, Spider-Man swings off as police sirens wail, missing his chance for an introduction.

The two heroes soon reconvene over the dazed Doctor Octopus. Invincible, apologetic, explains he‚Äôs from another dimension and mistook Doc Ock for a villain from his world. Before they can fully connect, a recovered Ock grabs Spider-Man and smashes Invincible through a wall. The young hero retaliates with overwhelming force, punching Ock through another building and ending the fight. Their victory is short-lived as police arrive, forcing the two heroes to flee to a nearby rooftop.

On the rooftop, the emotional core of their encounter unfolds. Spider-Man confronts Invincible, admonishing him for using potentially lethal force. The criticism shatters Invincible‚Äôs stoic facade; he breaks down, tears streaming down his face. He confesses he was sent to this dimension by a villain named Angstrom Levy, who is torturing him by throwing him through realities to weaken him. Invincible‚Äôs greatest fear is for his mother, whom Levy attacked to discover his secret identity. He recounts his own tragic backstory‚Äîhow his father, Omni-Man, betrayed his family and the world. Spider-Man, no stranger to loss and responsibility, immediately empathizes. He sees the good in the distraught young man and offers his trust and support. This moment of vulnerability forges a bond between them. They formally introduce themselves, leading to a lighthearted debate where Invincible calls Spider-Man‚Äôs name ‚Äúlame‚Äù and ‚Äúlazy,‚Äù causing Spidey a moment of comical self-doubt.

Deciding to team up, Spider-Man takes Invincible to Avengers Tower for help tracking the escaped Doc Ock. After a brief, awkward stop at Peter‚Äôs apartment where Invincible meets Aunt May and Mary Jane, they arrive at the tower. Invincible‚Äôs earnest attempt to guess the Avengers‚Äô names based on their appearances (‚ÄúClaw-Man,‚Äù ‚ÄúRobot-Man‚Äù) further cements his belief in literal naming conventions. After Iron Man locates Doc Ock at the harbor, Spider-Man insists he and Invincible can handle it alone.

At the docks, Doc Ock reveals his rampage was a deliberate trap. The final battle is swift and brutal. Annoyed by the prolonged fight and Ock‚Äôs taunts, a frustrated Invincible grabs two of the villain‚Äôs mechanical arms and rips them apart, decisively ending the threat. Immediately, another portal opens. Understanding this is his only way home, Invincible shares a quick, friendly farewell with Spider-Man and flies toward it. In a last-second, impulsive decision, Spider-Man shoots a web-line to follow, wanting to help his new friend. But the portal snaps shut, severing the web. Left alone, a sobered Spider-Man reflects on the immense danger he almost jumped into and swings home to his wife, wishing Invincible luck on his journey.
