## Additional Editing Notes
Use tense, action-oriented music for the fight scenes. Switch to a more somber, emotional track for the rooftop conversation on pages 8 and 9. Build back to a heroic, triumphant theme for the final battle and farewell. Pacing is key: quick cuts for action, and longer holds for emotional beats and major plot points like the arm-rip on page 20.

## CapCut Project Settings
- **Aspect Ratio:** 9:16 (Portrait)
- **Resolution:** 1080x1920
- **Frame Rate:** 30 FPS

## Audio Recommendations
- Add background music (low volume, dramatic/action theme)
- Consider adding sound effects for action scenes
- Ensure audio doesn't overpower narration

## Final Tips
1. Keep transitions smooth but allow scenes to breathe (longer durations)
2. Use consistent timing between scenes (aim for 3-6 seconds per scene)
3. Add text overlays for character names if needed
4. Preview on mobile device before publishing
5. Ensure first 3 seconds are engaging to hook viewers
6. Fill the 55-72 second duration with meaningful content, avoid rushed pacing
