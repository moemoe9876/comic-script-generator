After escaping captivity, the symbiote starts a global pandemic, infecting animals and people to build a massive hive mind. And with every new host, Carnage gets smarter and stronger. Realizing the scale of the threat, the Avengers assemble a team to take him down. Captain America leads Wolverine and The Thing to confront the growing horde, hoping to cut the head off the snake. But when they arrive, they\u2019re greeted by an army of symbiote-controlled civilians. The heroes fight valiantly, only to be completely overwhelmed by the sheer numbers. Carnage infects them one by one, adding Earth\u2019s mightiest heroes to his growing collection.\n\nWith their heavy hitters gone, the remaining heroes are desperate. They turn to their last hope, Tony Stark, believing his genius is the only thing that can stop the symbiote from spreading. And while the world falls into chaos, Tony locks himself in his lab, working day and night on a technological countermeasure. He knows a biological cure is impossible, so he focuses on what he does best: building suits of armor. He designs an entire fleet of armors, telling the few remaining heroes that they\u2019re resistant to symbiote control. This is their final chance to take back the planet.\n\nAs Carnage\u2019s forces close in on his tower, Iron Man leads the last defenders onto the battlefield. He unleashes his new Iron Legion, and for a moment, it looks like they might actually win. But when the heroes try to pilot the suits, they find themselves locked out. All of a sudden, Tony\u2019s armor turns a horrifying crimson red. He reveals the terrible truth. He was infected weeks ago. He explains that he saw no way to beat Carnage, so he chose to join him instead. The armors were never for the heroes. They were for Carnage's new world order, creating an unstoppable army that finally allows Carnage to take over the world.\n\n**TITLE SUGGESTIONS**\n\n*   How Did Carnage Take Over The Entire World?\n*   Iron Man Betrays The Avengers To Help Carnage\n*   The Day Carnage Infected Every Hero On Earth\n*   How Carnage Outsmarted The Avengers\n*   Carnage Creates An Unstoppable Iron Man Army"
