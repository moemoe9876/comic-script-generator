The story begins in a dark urban alleyway where Spider-Man is engaged in a fierce battle with his nemesis, Doctor Octopus. Despite Spider-Man's constant taunts and quips, the fight is not going his way. An overconfident reliance on his Spider-Sense leads to him being caught off guard and slammed into a brick wall by one of Doc Ock's powerful mechanical arms. Just as the villain closes in, a mysterious, flying hero named Invincible appears and saves Spider-Man by throwing Doctor Octopus through a strange, glowing yellow portal.

Initially confused, Spider-Man seeks out his savior. Their first proper conversation is abruptly interrupted when a recovered Doctor Octopus bursts from the rubble and punches the distracted Invincible through a building. Invincible quickly retaliates, knocking the villain out with a single, powerful blow. Before they can celebrate, armed police arrive and order the two heroes to freeze, prompting them to flee the scene together.

Finding refuge on a city rooftop at dusk, Spider-Man lectures Invincible on the dangers of using excessive force, fearing he may have killed Doctor Octopus. The admonishment causes Invincible to break down emotionally. He reveals he is from another dimension, stranded there by a villain named Angstrom Levy who is tormenting him by sending him through different realities to weaken him before a final, fatal confrontation. Invincible shares his tragic historyâ€”from his superhero father's betrayal to his current fear for his mother's safety at Levy's hands.

Moved by his story and recognizing his inherent goodness, Spider-Man decides to trust Invincible. After formally introducing themselves by their hero and civilian names (Peter Parker and Mark Grayson), Invincible offers to help Spider-Man while he's trapped in this dimension. Peter accepts and suggests they start by tracking down Doctor Octopus, proposing a visit to Avengers Tower for information. Before heading to the tower, Peter makes a quick stop at his apartment, where Invincible meets Aunt May and Mary Jane Watson.

At Avengers Tower, Invincible is awestruck as he is introduced to the premier super-team, including Captain America, Iron Man, and Wolverine, whom he comically mocks for their "on-the-nose" names. After Spider-Man explains the situation, Iron Man gets a bead on Doctor Octopus's location from the police band. Spider-Man politely declines the Avengers' offer of help, confident that he and his new partner can handle the villain themselves.

To reach the location quickly, Invincible flies Spider-Man across the city to a harbor where Doctor Octopus is terrorizing civilians, revealing his rampage was a deliberate trap to lure out his nemesis. In the ensuing battle, Invincible is initially hesitant to use his full strength, mindful of Spider-Man's earlier warning. However, after witnessing Spider-Man's struggle and growing increasingly frustrated with the villain's attacks, Invincible becomes enraged. He ends the fight decisively by grabbing Doctor Octopus's mechanical tentacles and ripping them apart with his bare hands.

With Doctor Octopus defeated, a glowing portal opens nearby. Invincible explains that his nemesis is summoning him for the next leg of his forced journey. Encouraged by a grateful police officer to continue his mission, Invincible bids Spider-Man farewell and flies toward the portal. In a last-second, impulsive decision, Spider-Man tries to follow to lend his aid, but the portal snaps shut, severing his web line and leaving him behind. Swinging home alone, Spider-Man reflects on the close call, chastises himself for the risk, and wishes his new friend good luck, wherever he may be.
