After gathering every useful hero available and Squirrel Girl, the Avengers arrive at Laaria to end Doom's reign, only to be completely humiliated in front of the whole world. As time went on and people's lives began to change for the better, Doom's followers started to grow in number. While the Avengers are desperately trying to come up with a plan to stop him, believing that Doom has every world leader under some form of mind control, Carol comes up with a plan to free them from Doom's influence. And while she believes that the Avengers are more than powerful enough to beat Victor, she's called in a few villains to help them. With the help of their new allies, Captain Marvel plans to distract Doom while Scarlet Witch frees every world leader from his mind control. And with everyone on board, they arrive at the Lavarian border once again. Having anticipated their arrival, Doom welcomes the Avengers with his dinosaur variant. And while he's surprised that Earth's mightiest heroes were desperate enough to team up with a group of villains, he reassures them that they stand no chance of winning. While the Avengers are keeping Doom distracted, Scarlet Witch enters the mind of every politician under Doom's influence. But after spending hours trying to break their mind control, she's shocked to learn the truth. Despite what they thought, Doom didn't use his powers to control the politicians. He simply offered to give them whatever they needed to gain their support, money, power, or drugs."

"How did Spider-Man almost get Peter Parker killed? While Peter is out on a date with MJ, they are interrupted by a giant tric sentinel destroying Manhattan. MJ asks if he needs to get out of here, but Peter doesn't think he'll have to because Spider-Man is already there to deal with it. A few days ago, Peter went to visit Dr. Connors at the university to discuss the isotope genome accelerator, the device that gave him his powers all those years ago. Connors explains that with the accelerator's help, he plans to separate his human side from the lizard, but their talk is cut short by Taskmaster and Black Ant, who came to steal the device. Taskmaster throws Peter out of the way, only for him to accidentally turn on the accelerator, separating Spider-Man and Peter Parker from each other. Once Spider-Man has dealt with the villains, he and Peter swing away to talk about what just happened. But after realizing that they can finally live separate lives, Spidey goes to do some superhero stuff, leaving Peter alone on the rooftop. Without his powers, Peter can finally live a normal life. He can go back to school and settle down with the woman he loves. All while Spider-Man is having the time of his life, going on talk shows, and making millions of dollars with various sponsorships. But when he starts to swing people around the city for money, Peter decides it's time to have a talk. Realizing that the experiment left Spider-Man with no sense of responsibility or intellect, Peter tries to remind him of why they decided to become heroes in the first place, only for Spidey to web him to a wall and swing away. Knowing that he needs to get his powers back or somebody will get hurt, Peter steals the accelerator from Dr. Connors lab, but when he tries to turn everything back to normal, they are attacked by an army of Tsentinels. As they try to run away, a sentinel behind them is about to blow both of them up, only for Peter to save Spider-Man's life by pushing him away. Lying half dead on the ground, Peter hopes that Spider-Man has finally learned to be more responsible. But since it didn't really work, he activates the accelerator with his web shooter, merging their bodies back"

And after giving him a hug, Wade teleports both of them to hell, where they're captured by Dormamu. As Deadpool continues to annoy Spider-Man with his jokes, Peter asks Dormamu if he can torture them separately, buying Wade just enough time to dislocate his hip and cut themselves loose. When Dormamu's mindless ones attack them, Wade is confused why Spidey is angry with him, saying he only wanted to give him a battle worthy of an Avenger. But when even Dormamu questions why Spider-Man would team up with an idiot like Deadpool, Wade ends the battle by giving the mindless ones brains, causing them to turn against their master. Thinking that this must be a bad dream, Spider-Man tells Deadpool to immediately take them home. But by the time they arrive, Hydroman has absorbed all the water from the sewers, demanding $100 million or he'll drown the city in its own filth. After getting blasted with sewer water, Deadpool blames Spider-Man for unleashing a walking toilet on the city. But when Peter asks if he has any grenades on him, he throws Wade into Hydroman, causing both of them to explode. While Deadpool's legs are starting to grow back, Spider-Man cleans his suit on a rooftop. But as he gets ready to leave, Wade asks to hear him out for a second. Deadpool explains that he's been trying to change and thought that if he spent more time with Spider-Man, he could start to earn his respect.

Not having the time for healing factor guys, Daredevil calls in Thor for help, who accidentally disintegrates both of them into a pile of ash. As Deadpool begins to regenerate, he notices that Madcap is gone when he suddenly hears a strange new voice inside his head. Thinking that Mad Cap put the voice inside his head to annoy him, Deadpool wanted to get rid of it at first, but as time went on, he started to like it more and more.

And after promising Ellie that he'll be back by the end of the next issue, he and Taskmaster head out to deal with Death Grip. Deadpool kicks the door open, only for his head to catch on fire. And as Taskmaster begins to shoot deathgrip students with his arrows, Wade asks if they have any idea how expensive it is to get a new mask made.

And after hitting him in the head with a gun, he gets ready to end their rivalry as quickly as it started. But simply by touching his chest, Death Grip nullifies Wade's healing factor. As Wade begins to cough up blood, Deathgrip asks if he's already run out of jokes to say, and to see if his plan really worked, slashes Deadpool's chest wide open with his hand. Deathgrip explains that after underestimating the mercenary during their last fight, he located the Muramasa Blade, the weapon that can neutralize any healing factor, and took its power into himself. Realizing that he may have underestimated his opponent, a strange feeling comes over Wade, a feeling he hasn't felt since he got his powers. Fear."

The doctors insist they have a moral obligation to save every patient, even the Joker. And the only solution is to inject a compound directly into his brain at a microscopic level. Not sure why he should bother, Adam refuses. But when they explain there's a chance the procedure might kill the Joker, Ray asks where he can sign up. With the compound in hand, Ray enters Joker's brain through his nose. And after he enters the bloodstream, he stops for a second to think about how terrible it would be if he accidentally caused a blood clot. Shrinking further to fit into the synaptic gaps, Ry arrives at the root of the problem. But as he prepares to administer the compound, a lightning bolt hits him, pulling him into one of Joker's memories.

But with time travel off the table, Franklin suggests they travel to another universe where the Fantastic 4 are just about to get their powers. After the smartest man alive got outsmarted by his 15-year-old son, they all rush to the Baxter building and within hours they arrive in an alternate reality where their counterparts lives are about to change forever. As the cosmic rays are approaching, Ben gets ready to turn back to his old rocky self. And while Sue shields the rest of them from the storm, he gets exposed to its full power. After the other Fantastic 4 return to Earth, their powers kick in just as they were supposed to. But unfortunately for Ben, nothing's changed. As they continue to travel from universe to universe, they watch different versions of the Fantastic 4 get transformed. Some look just like them, others are completely different. But no matter what world they visit, the outcome's always the same. The team gets their powers while Ben gets nothing. Realizing that the cosmic rays from alternate universes won't work, Ben secretly alters their next destination, sending them to their own universe just moments before they got their powers. As the ship nears the storm, Ben gets ready to be exposed to its full power. And as his body finally starts to transform, he happily tells the others that it worked.

Example 10 - "Joker vs Every Robin Over The Years #joker #shorts":
"Joker is crying in his cell, but when his therapist asks him to get serious, he offers to tell them another story that will twist their guts about a good friend of his, Robin, the boy wonder. This poor kid is put into harm's way every night by that lunatic Batman who forces him to go unarmed against Gotham's worst criminals when he should be doing his homework. The therapist asks Joker if he's concerned for Robin's well-being, but he simply wants to kill him, which he has managed to do at least once. Over the years, Joker had countless encounters with the boy wonder and watched as he grew into a man. Then one day, he was gone. For a long time, Joker wondered what could have happened to him. Did he get a real job or did he settle down? Or perhaps a worse fate befall the boy wonder. A few months went by with Batman going solo. Then when he least expected it, a new Robin showed up, and Joker really liked this one. When he finally captured this new Robin, he was ever so surprised, but not half as surprised as when Joker beat him to death with a crowbar, then blew him up just to make sure. After Jason Todd's death, Joker finally had Batman all to himself. But after getting the crap kicked out of him over and over again, he began to grow bored. He's lost his passion and was just going through the motions until another Robin showed up out of the blue. Joker's world was rocked to its core, wondering how many more times he had to kill the brat. The more he thought about it, the less sense it made, which usually wouldn't bother him. But this time, it did until a very pleasant thought occurred to him. There was more than one Robin. He either killed the others or they retired. And if that's true, then perhaps there was more than one Batman. Maybe he did succeed in killing him all those times."

Before he can respond, the old man calls him, telling Wade not to listen to that painted harlot. Deadpool dusts himself off and walks back to Rhino's house, shooting all of his friends, only to be thrown out again. WDE's phone rings again and Mrs. Whitaker offers him half a million dollars to leave, which he happily accepts. As he tries to get into his car and leave, an annoyed Rhino starts to chase him. Deciding that it's time to retreat, Deadpool jumps onto a nearby motorcycle, telling the rider that unless he's Galactis under his leather jacket, he'd better drive fast. He arrives at his headquarters, rushing downstairs to his collection of Avengers memorabilia. He throws on Hulk's pants and Iron Man's boots, hoping they'll give him an edge. But when Rhino catches up, the pants prove to be useless. As his final chance for survival, Deadpool resorts to spraying Rhino with Ant-Man's shrinking gas, reducing him to a miniature size. As the negotiations continue, the old man ups the bid to $1 million. And after grabbing a saw, Deadpool apologizes to Mini Rhino, but some rich idiot wants his fake little horn. Wade delivers the horn to Mr. Whitaker, telling him and his wife that they are both seriously screwed up. He puts a gun on the desk, telling them to either fix their marriage or get a permanent divorce. As he walks away, feeling pretty optimistic about the two of them, he hears a loud bang. He returns home to find a very angry mini rhino waiting for him. Wade hands him an Oreo."

But since it will always be too expensive for the average person, she wants Bruce to be one of the lucky few to take it, arguing that some lives are worth more than others.

But when he arrives home, he finds a letter on his gate containing the truth about his new girlfriend. More than 20 years ago, the night Scarlet was born, her father got into a terrible car crash. And if it weren't for Bruce's father, Thomas Wayne, he would have died. After a 9-hour long surgery, Thomas saved the man's life, not knowing that by doing that, he'd just signed his and his wife's death sentence.

But after the judge deems Joker competent enough, he calls him to take the stand. Joker claims to be innocent, but when the district attorney asks if he's aware of the clever crimes he's being accused of, he gets deeply offended. To his lawyer's shock, Joker begins to list all the crimes he's done over the years, calling himself the Einstein of crime, saying that the person who committed the stamp murders is an amateur at best. When the jury is about to deliver the verdict, Joker is confident he'll walk free, only to be found guilty on all accounts, receiving the death penalty. The next day, Joker is taken to Blackgate prison, and once he's shown to his cell, his lawyer comes for a visit.
